SmartThings Device handler for WLED

 - Copy all content of the device handler file into you ST IDE.
 - Add device through IDE
 - Setup IP and port in ST app

Please note that this was custom made for my needs, and that on/off, color and brightness are working. None of the effects etc were implemented. Also confirmed to work with Google Home when linked to ST.
